# Using Azure DocumentDB #

---

<a name="Overview"></a>
## Overview ##

Whether it targets businesses, consumers, or both, an app is only as meaningful as the data that drives it. With consumer and organizational requirements changing constantly, as well as the need to store, index, and optimize data and structures as they change, the need for a more open, flexible, and schema-agnostic data solution has been become essential. Azure DocumentDB addresses these challenges and makes it easy to adjust and adapt data models on the fly, as business logic and application scenarios change.

[DocumentDB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/documentdb/) is a fully managed NoSQL database service built for fast performance, high availability, elastic scaling, and ease of development. As a schema-free NoSQL database, DocumentDB provides rich and familiar SQL query capabilities over JSON data, ensuring that 99% of your reads are served under 10 milliseconds and 99% of your writes are served under 15 milliseconds. These unique benefits make DocumentDB a great fit for Web, mobile, gaming, IoT, and many other applications that need seamless scale and global replication.

In this lab, you will deploy an Azure DocumentDB database to store customer and product order information for the fictitious company *Adventure Works*, and you will connect it to Azure Search to index the data and implement auto-suggest. You will also write a Web app that uses the database and demonstrates how easily applications can consume data from DocumentDB.

## Exercise 1: Create a DocumentDB account ##

The first step in working with Azure DocumentDB is to create a DocumentDB account to hold databases, collections, and documents. In this exercise, you will create a DocumentDB account using the Azure Portal.

1.	Open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) in your browser. If you are asked to sign in, do so with your Microsoft Account.

1.	Click **+ New**, followed by **Database** and **DocumentDB (NoSQL)**.	

    ![Creating a DocumentDB account](Images/portal-create-new-documentdb.png)

    _Creating a DocumentDB account_

1. In the "NoSQL (DocumentDB)" blade, give the account a unique name such as "documentdbhol" and make sure a green check mark appears next to it. (You can only use numbers and lowercase letters since the name becomes part of a DNS name.) Make sure **DocumentDB** is selected for **NoSQL API**. Select **Create new** under **Resource group** and name the resource group "DocumentDBResourceGroup." Select the **Location** nearest you, and then click the **Create** button.

    ![Specifying DocumentDB parameters](Images/portal-configure-new-documentdb.png)

    _Specifying DocumentDB parameters_

1. Click **Resource groups** in the ribbon on the left side of the portal, and then click the resource group created for the DocumentDB account.
 
    ![Opening the resource group](Images/open-resource-group.png)

    _Opening the resource group_

1. Wait until "Deploying" changes to "Succeeded," indicating that the DocumentDB account has been deployed.

	> Refresh the page in the browser every now and then to update the deployment status. Clicking the **Refresh** button in the resource-group blade refreshes the list of resources in the resource group, but does not reliably update the deployment status.

    ![Viewing the deployment status](Images/deployment-status.png)

    _Viewing the deployment status_

Your DocumentDB account is now provisioned and ready for you to start working with it.

<a name="Exercise2"></a>
## Exercise 2: Create a database and collections ##

Now that youâ€™ve deployed a DocumentDB account, the next step is to create a database and add collections to it in preparation for storing documents. In this exercise, you will create a database and add three collections to it for storing information about customers, products, and orders.

1. Click the DocumentDB account that you deployed in [Exercise 1](#Exercise1).

    ![Opening the DocumentDB account](Images/open-documentdb.png)

    _Opening the DocumentDB account_

1. Click **+ Add Collection**.

    ![Adding a collection](Images/add-collection.png)

    _Adding a collection_

1. Enter "Customers" (without quotation marks) as the **Collection Id** and select **10 GB** as the **STORAGE CAPACITY**. Select **Create New** under **DATABASE** and specify "CustomerOrders" as the database name. Then click the **OK** button.

    ![Creating a Customers collection](Images/create-collection-and-database.png)

    _Creating a Customers collection_

1. Click **+ Add Collection** again. Fill in the form as shown below to create a second collection named "Orders." Be sure to add it to the existing database ("CustomerOrders") rather than create a new database. Then click **OK**.

    ![Adding an Orders collection](Images/add-orders-collection.png)

    _Adding an Orders collection_

1. Click **+ Add Collection** again. Create a third collection named "Products" with the same settings as the "Customers" and "Orders" collections. Once more, be sure to add it to the existing database ("CustomerOrders") rather than create a new database.

The next step is to upload documents containing data regarding customers, products, and orders to the collections you created.

<a name="Exercise3"></a>
## Exercise 3: Populate collections with documents ##

There are several ways to populate DocumentDB collections with documents, including programmatic import via the [Azure SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB/) and the [Microsoft DocumentDB Data Migration Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46436). In this exercise, you will populate your collections with data by uploading JSON documents through the Azure Portal.

1. Click **Document Explorer** in the menu on the left. Make sure **Customers** is selected in the drop-down list of collections, and click **Upload**.

    ![Opening Document Explorer](Images/open-document-explorer.png)

    _Opening Document Explorer_

1. Click the folder icon. Select all of the files in this lab's "Resources/Customers" folder, and then click the **Upload** button.

    ![Uploading customer data](Images/upload-customer-data.png)

    _Uploading customer data_

	Each of the files you uploaded is a JSON document containing information about one customer. Here is one of those files:

	```JSON
	{
	  "CustomerID": "ALFKI",
	  "CompanyName": "Alfreds Futterkiste",
	  "ContactName": "Maria Anders",
	  "ContactTitle": "Sales Representative",
	  "Address": "Obere Str. 57",
	  "City": "Berlin",
	  "Region": null,
	  "PostalCode": "12209",
	  "Latitude": 52.54971,
	  "Longitude": 13.49041,
	  "Country": "Germany",
	  "Phone": "030-0074321",
	  "Fax": "030-0076545"
	}
	```

	There are 91 files in all, so the Customers collection is now populated with data for 91 customers.

1. Close the "Upload Document" blade and return to the "Document Explorer" blade. Select **Orders** from the drop-down list of collections and click **Upload**. Then upload all of the files in this lab's "Resources/Orders" folder to the Orders collection.

    ![Uploading order data](Images/upload-order-data.png)

    _Uploading order data_

1. Repeat this process to upload all of the files in this lab's "Resources/Products" folder to the Products collection.

    ![Uploading product data](Images/upload-product-data.png)

    _Uploading product data_

1. The next step is to validate the document uploads by querying one or more of the collections. Click **Query Explorer** in the menu on the left. Select **Orders** in the drop-down list of collections, and then click the **Run Query**.

	> Although you won't use DocumentDB's rich query capabilities directly in this lab, be aware that DocumentDB supports a variation of the SQL query language for extracting information from JSON data. For more information, and plenty of examples, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/documentdb/documentdb-sql-query.

    ![Querying the Orders collection](Images/open-query-explorer.png)

    _Querying the Orders collection_

1. Confirm that you see the query results below.

    ![Query results](Images/query-results.png)

    _Query results_

1. If you would like to confirm that the product and customer uploads succeeded too, run the same query against the Products and Customers collections.

The database that you created now has three collections that are populated with data. Now let's index the data so searches can be performed quickly.

<a name="Exercise4"></a>
## Exercise 4: Connect Azure Search ##

One of the benefits of using DocumentDB is that it integrates easily with [Azure Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/search/). Azure Search is a managed Search-as-a-Service solution that delegates server and infrastructure management to Microsoft and lets you index data sources for lightning-fast searches. Search can be accessed through a simple [REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/) or with the [Azure Search SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-howto-dotnet-sdk), enabling you to employ it in Web apps, mobile apps, and other types of applications. In this exercise, you will deploy an Azure Search service and connect it to the DocumentDB database that you created in [Exercise 2](#Exercise2).

1.	In the Azure Portal, click **+ New**, followed by **Web + Mobile** and then **Azure Search**.
	
    ![Creating a new Azure Search service](Images/portal-create-new-search-service.png)

    _Creating a new Azure Search service_

1. In the "New Search Service" blade, give the service a unique name in the **URL** box and make sure a green check mark appears next to it. (You can only use numbers and lowercase letters since the name becomes part of a DNS name.) Select **Use existing** under **Resource group** and select the resource group you created for the DocumentDB account in [Exercise 1](#Exercise1).Select the **Location** nearest you, and then click the **Create** button.

    ![Specifying Search parameters](Images/portal-configure-new-search-service.png)

    _Specifying Search parameters_

1. Click **Resource groups** in the ribbon on the left side of the portal, and then click the resource group containing the DocumentDB account and Search service.
 
    ![Opening the resource group](Images/open-resource-group.png)

    _Opening the resource group_

1. Wait until "Deploying" changes to "Succeeded," indicating that the Search service has been deployed. Then click the Search service.

	> Refresh the page in the browser every now and then to update the deployment status. Clicking the **Refresh** button in the resource-group blade refreshes the list of resources in the resource group, but does not reliably update the deployment status.

    ![Opening the Search service](Images/open-search.png)

    _Opening the Search service_

1. Click **Import data**.
	
    ![Importing data](Images/portal-select-import-data.png)

    _Importing data_

1. Click **Data Source**, followed by **DocumentDB**. In the "New data source" blade, type "customers" (without quotation marks) into the **Name** field. Click **Select an account** and select the DocumentDB account you created in [Exercise 1](#Exercise1). Select the **CustomerOrders** database and the **Customers** collection. Then click **OK**.

    ![Connecting to a data source](Images/portal-connect-search-datasource.png)

    _Connecting to a data source_

1. Click **Index** in the "Import data" blade. In the "Index" blade, type "customerindex" (without quotation marks) into the **Index name** field, and then check all five boxes in the CompanyName row. Then click **OK**.

    ![Configuring a search index](Images/portal-configure-search-index.png)

    _Configuring a search index_

1. Click **Indexer** in the "Import data" blade. In the "Indexer" blade, type "customerindexer" into the **Name** field and click **OK**. Finish up by clicking the **OK** button at the bottom of the "Import data" blade.
	
    ![Configuring a search indexer](Images/portal-configure-search-indexer.png)

    _Configuring a search indexer_
 
With the DocumentDB database deployed and an Azure Search service connected to it, it is time to put both to work by building a Web app that uses them to display customer, product, and order information.

<a name="Exercise5"></a>
## Exercise 5: Build an Azure Web App ##

[Azure Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-web-overview/) allow you to quickly and easily deploy Web sites built with tools and languages you're familiar with. In this exercise, you will build an ASP.NET MVC Web app with Visual Studio and configure it so that it can be deployed to the cloud as an Azure Web App. The app will connect to the DocumentDB database deployed and populated with data in previous exercises and provide a browser-based front-end for viewing and searching the data.

1.	Start Visual Studio 2015 and use the **File -> New -> Project** command to create a new Visual C# ASP.NET Web Application project named "AdventureDoc" (short for "Adventure Works Documents").
 
    ![Creating a new Web Application project](Images/vs-create-new-web-app.png)

    _Creating a new Web Application project_

1.	In the "New ASP.NET Web Application" dialog, select the **MVC** template. Then click the **Change Authentication** button and select **No Authentication**. (This simplifies the app by omitting authentication infrastructure.) Next, make sure the **Host in the cloud** box is checked and that **App Service** is selected in the drop-down list below the check box. Finally, click **OK**.
 
    ![Configuring the project](Images/vs-configure-web-app.png)

    _Configuring the project_

1.	In the "Create App Service" dialog, make sure **DocumentDBResourceGroup** is selected under **Resource Group**. (This will add the Azure Web App to the same resource group as the DocumentDB account and the Azure Search service, which is handy because deleting the resource group will delete all three.) Then click the **New** button next to **App Service Plan** and select the location nearest you for hosting the Web App, and **Free** as the **Size.** Click **OK** to dismiss the "Configure App Service Plan" dialog. Then click **Create** at the bottom of the "Create App Service" dialog.
	
 	![Creating an App Service](Images/vs-create-app-service.png)

    _Creating an App Service_

1. Take a moment to review the project structure in the Solution Explorer window. Among other things, there's a folder named "Controllers" that holds the project's MVC controllers, and a folder named "Views" that holds the project's views. You will be working with assets in these folders and others as you implement the application.

1. Use Visual Studio's **Debug -> Start Without Debugging** command (or simply press **Ctrl+F5**) to launch the application in your browser. Here's how the application looks in its present state:
	 
    ![The initial application](Images/vs-initial-application.png)

	    public string Description { get; set; }
	    public string DocumentContent { get; set; }
	}
	```

1. Repeat this process to add an *OrderViewModel* class to the "Models" folder, and replace the empty class with the following class definition:
	
	```C#
	public class OrderViewModel
	{
	    public string SearchQuery { get; set; }
	    public List<SearchResultInformation> SearchResults { get; set; }
	    public List<string> Collections { get; set; }
	    public string SelectedCollectionName { get; set; }
	    public string SearchResultTitle { get; set; }
	    public string SearchResultDescription { get; set; }
	}
	```
1.	In the Solution Explorer window, right-click the **AdventureDocs** project and use the **Add -> New Folder** command to add a folder named "Helpers" to the project.
	
1. Right-click the "Helpers" folder and use the **Add -> Class...** command to add a file named **DocumentHelper.cs** to the folder. Replace the contents of the file with the following statements:

	            var orderItems = orderQuery.ToList();
	
	            var results = (from item in orderItems

	        }
	    }
	}
	```

1. Open **HomeController.cs** in the project's "Controllers" folder. Add the following using statements to the top of the file:

	```C#
	using System.Threading.Tasks;
	using AdventureDocs.Models;
	```

1. Replace the *Index* method in **HomeController.cs** with the following implementation:

	```C#
	public async Task<ActionResult> Index()
	{
	    var model = new OrderViewModel() { SearchResults = new List<SearchResultInformation>() };
	
	    var documentClient = Helpers.DocumentHelper.GetDocumentClient();
	
	    var availableCollections = await Helpers.DocumentHelper.GetAvailableCollectionNamesAsync(documentClient);
	
	    var searchResults = (List<SearchResultInformation>)TempData["SearchResults"];
	    var searchQuery = (string)Request["SearchQuery"];
	
	    if (searchResults != null)
	    {
	        model.SearchQuery = (string)TempData["SearchQuery"];
	        model.SearchResults = (List<SearchResultInformation>)TempData["SearchResults"];
	
	        model.SelectedCollectionName = (string)TempData["SelectedCollectionName"];
	        model.SearchResultTitle = $"{model.SelectedCollectionName}";
	        model.SearchResultDescription = $"The following results were found in {model.SelectedCollectionName} for '{model.SearchQuery.ToUpper()}':";
	    }
	    else if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(searchQuery))
	    {

	        model.SelectedCollectionName = "Customers";
	        model.SearchResultTitle = "";
	        model.SearchResultDescription = "";
	    }
	
	    model.Collections = availableCollections;
	    return View(model);
	}
	
	```
	
1. Add the following methods to the *HomeController* class in **HomeController.cs**:
	
	```C#
	public ActionResult Lookup()
	{
	    ViewBag.Message = "Your application description page.";
        return View();
    }
	      
    [HttpGet]
    public ActionResult ViewSource(string[] content)
    {
        return new JsonResult
	    {
	        JsonRequestBehavior = JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet,
	        Data = content[0]
	    };
    }
	
    [HttpPost]
    public ActionResult Search(OrderViewModel model)
    {
        ViewBag.Message = "Your application description page.";
	
        string searchQuery = model.SearchQuery + "";
	
        var documentClient = Helpers.DocumentHelper.GetDocumentClient();
	
        List<SearchResultInformation> searchResults = new List<SearchResultInformation>();
	
        switch (model.SelectedCollectionName)
        {
            case "Customers":
                searchResults = Helpers.DocumentHelper.GetOrdersByCustomer(documentClient, searchQuery);
                break;
            case "Products":
                searchResults = Helpers.DocumentHelper.GetOrdersByProduct(documentClient, searchQuery);
                break;
            case "Orders":
                searchResults = Helpers.DocumentHelper.GetOrdersByOrder(documentClient, searchQuery);
                break;
            default:
                break;
        }
	
        TempData["SearchQuery"] = searchQuery;
        TempData["SearchResults"] = searchResults;
        TempData["SelectedCollectionName"] = model.SelectedCollectionName;
	
        return RedirectToAction("Index");
    }
	```

1. Open **Index.cshmtl** in the "Views/Home" folder and replace its contents with the following statements:

	```HTML
	@{
	    ViewBag.Title = "AdventureDocs";
	}
	
	<div class="row">
	    @model AdventureDocs.Models.OrderViewModel
	    <div>
	        <h2>Document Search</h2>
	        <p>
	            To search documents in your Azure DocumentDB database, enter a value, select a DocumentDB collection, and click Search.
	        </p>
	
	        @using (Html.BeginForm("Search", "Home", FormMethod.Post))
	        {
	            <div>Search for:</div>
	            @Html.TextBoxFor(o => Model.SearchQuery)
	            <p></p>
	            <div>Select a collection:</div>
	            @Html.DropDownListFor(x => x.SelectedCollectionName, new SelectList(Model.Collections))
	            <input type="submit" value="Search">
	        }
	
	        <div>
	            <h4>@Html.DisplayFor(o => Model.SearchResultTitle)</h4>
	            <div>@Html.DisplayFor(o => Model.SearchResultDescription)</div>
	            <table style="margin:10px" border="0" cellpadding="3">
	                @foreach (var item in Model.SearchResults)
	                {
	                    <tr>
	                        <td>
	                            <strong>@Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => item.Title)</strong>
	                        </td>
	                        <td>
	                            <em>@Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => item.Description)</em>
	                        </td>
	
	                        <td>
	                            @Html.ActionLink(
	                            linkText: "[view document]",
	                            actionName: "ViewSource",
	                            controllerName: "Home",
	                            routeValues: new { content = item.DocumentContent },
	                            htmlAttributes: null)
	                        </td>
	                    </tr>
	                }
	            </table>
	        </div>
	    </div>
	</div>
	```

1. Find **About.cshmtl** in the "Views/Home" folder. Right-click the file and use the **Rename** command to change its name to **Lookup.cshtml**. This is the view that will serve as the document lookup page.

1. Replace the contents of **Lookup.cshtml** with the following statements:

	```HTML
	@Scripts.Render("~/bundles/jqueryui")
	
	<script type="text/javascript">
	Â Â Â Â $(document).ready(function () {
	Â 
	        $('#customers').autocomplete({
	            source: '@Url.Action("Suggest")',
	            autoFocus: true,
	            select: function (event, ui) {
	
	                if (ui.item) {
	                    $("#SearchQuery").val(ui.item.value);
	                    $("form").submit();
	                }
	            }
	Â Â Â Â     });Â 
	Â Â Â Â })
	</script>
	
	<div class="row">
	    <div class="col-md-4">
	        <h2>Customer Lookup</h2>
	        <p>
	            To search documents in your Azure DocumentDB database, enter a value and select an autosuggested customer.
	        </p>
	        <div>Search for:</div>
	        <input id="customers" name="customers">
	        <form action="/" method="post">
	            <input hidden="hidden" id="SearchQuery" name="SearchQuery" type="text" />
	        </form>
	    </div>
	    <div style="height:400px" class="col-md-4"></div>
	</div>
	```

1. Open **BundleConfig.cs** in the project's "App_Start" folder. Add the following code at the end of the **RegisterBundles** method:

	```C#
	bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle("~/bundles/jqueryui").Include("~/Scripts/jquery-ui-{version}.js"));
	bundles.Add(new StyleBundle("~/Content/themes/base/css").Include(
	            "~/Content/themes/base/jquery.ui.core.css",
	            "~/Content/themes/base/jquery.ui.autocomplete.css",
	            "~/Content/themes/base/jquery.ui.theme.css"));
	```

1. Use Visual Studio's **Debug -> Start Without Debugging** command (or press **Ctrl+F5**) to launch the application in your browser. 

1. **Type** the letter "a" in the **Search for** box and click the **Search** button. Confirm that a list of customer names starting with A appears on the page:
	
    ![Searching for customer names that begin with A](Images/vs-documentsearch-01.png)

    _Searching for customer names that begin with A_

1. Select **Products** from the list of collections and click the **Search** button. Confirm that a list of product names starting with A appears on the page:
	
    ![Searching for product names that begin with A](Images/vs-documentsearch-02.png)

    _Searching for product names that begin with A_

1. Replace the letter "a" in the **Search for** box with the letter "m." Then select **Orders** and click the **Search** button. Confirm that a list of orders appears, with the countries they were shipped to listed on the right:
	
    ![Searching for orders shipped to countries that begin with M](Images/vs-documentsearch-03.png)

    _Searching for orders shipped to countries that begin with M_

1. The Orders listing displays the CompanyName and ShipRegion values from the orders returned in the search results. To view the entire order, click **[view document]** to the right of an order. The result is the JSON defining the order:
	
    ![Viewing an entire order](Images/vs-documentsearch-04.png)

    _Viewing an entire order_	

This is a great start, and it demonstrates how an ASP.NET MVC Web app can access data stored in the cloud in a DocumentDB database. But right now, the search UI is somewhat clumsy; you have to enter letters blindly, without any feedback to tell you whether there are any matching documents. Let's enhance the UI by adding auto-suggest.

<a name="Exercise6"></a>
## Exercise 6: Add auto-suggest ##

Azure Search enables super-fast retrieval of indexed values in the data stores is is connected to. In this exercise, you will leverage that speed to add an auto-suggest list to customer search to provide feedback to the user as he or she types.

1. Return to Visual Studio. Right-click the "Helpers" folder and use the **Add -> Class...** command to add a file named **SearchHelper.cs** to the folder. Replace the contents of the file with the following statements:

	```C#
	using Microsoft.Azure.Search;
	using Microsoft.Azure.Search.Models;
	using System;
	using System.Collections.Generic;
	using System.Linq;
	using System.Threading.Tasks;
	using System.Web;
	using AdventureDocs.Models;
	
	namespace AdventureDocs.Helpers
	{
	    public static class SearchHelper
	    {
	        public static List<string> GetSuggestions(string query)
	        {
	            List<string> suggestions = new List<string>();
	
	            string searchServiceName = Microsoft.Azure.CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("SearchServiceName");
	            string searchServiceKey = Microsoft.Azure.CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("SearchServiceKey");
	
	            SearchServiceClient serviceClient = new SearchServiceClient(searchServiceName, new SearchCredentials(searchServiceKey));
	
	            ISearchIndexClient indexClient = serviceClient.Indexes.GetClient("customerindex");
	
	            DocumentSearchResult<Customer> response = indexClient.Documents.Search<Customer>($"{query.Trim()}*");
	
	            suggestions = (from result in response.Results
	                           select result.Document.CompanyName).ToList();
	
	            return suggestions;
	        }
	    }
	}
	```

1. Open **Web.config** and add the following statement to the \<appSettings\> section, replacing *search_service_name* with the name you assigned to the Azure Search service in Exercise 4, Step 2:

	```XML
	<add key="SearchServiceName" value="search_service_name" />
	```

1. Return to the Azure Portal and open the blade for the Azure Search service. Click **Keys**, followed by **Manage query keys**. Then copy the query key to the clipboard.

	> The purpose of query keys is to allow applications to query the Search service and to do so securely.

    ![Copying the query key to the clipboard](Images/portal-copy-search-query-key.png)

    _Copying the query key to the clipboard_

1. Return to Visual Studio. Add the following statement to the \<appSettings\> section of **Web.config**, replacing *search_service_key* with the query key on the clipboard.

	```XML
	<add key="SearchServiceKey" value="search_service_key" />
	```

1. Add the following methods to the *HomeController* class in **HomeController.cs**:
	
	```C#
	[HttpPost]
	public ActionResult AutoSearch(string item)
	{
	    ViewBag.Message = "Your application description page.";
	
	    string searchQuery = item + "";
	
	    TempData["SearchQuery"] = searchQuery;
	    TempData["SelectedCollectionName"] = "Customers";
	
	    return RedirectToAction("Index");
	}
	
	[HttpGet]
	public ActionResult Suggest(string term)
	{
	    List<string> suggestions = new List<string>();
	
	    suggestions = Helpers.SearchHelper.GetSuggestions(term);
	
	    return new JsonResult
	    {
	        JsonRequestBehavior = JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet,
	        Data = suggestions
	    };
	}
	```

1.	Use Visual Studio's **Debug -> Start Without Debugging** command (or press **Ctrl+F5**) to launch the application in your browser. 

1. Click **Customer Lookup**. Then type "ar" into the **Search for** box and wait for a list of suggested customers to appear.

    ![Auto-suggest in action](Images/vs-view-autosuggest.png)

    _Auto-suggest in action_

1. Select **Around the Horn** and press **Enter** to search for customers named "Around the Horn."

Auto-suggest vastly improves the search experience and is relatively easy to add thanks to some of the classes you imported in NuGet packages in [Exercise 5](#Exercise5).

When you created the project for the Web app in Visual Studio, you checked the **Host in the cloud** box so the app could be deployed to Azure, and you created an Azure App Service to host it. Up to now, the app has run locally. If you would like to deploy it to Azure so it can be opened from anywhere, simply right-click the project in Solution Explorer, select **Publish** from the context menu, and click the **Publish** button in the ensuing dialog. Once the app has been published, it will open in a browser window.

When you're finished using the app, it is recommended that you delete the resource group containing it. Since you placed the Azure Web App in the same resource group as the DocumentDB account and the Search service, deleting the resource group deletes **all** of these resources, removes all traces of this lab from your account, and prevents any further charges from being incurred for it. To delete the resource group, simply open the resource-group blade in the portal and click **Delete** at the top of the blade. You will be asked to type the resource group's name to confirm that you want to delete it, because once deleted, a resource group can't be recovered.

<a name="Summary"></a>
## Summary ##

In this hands-on lab you learned how to:

- Create an Azure DocumentDB account
- Create DocumentDB collections and populate them with documents
- Create an Azure Search service and and use it to index DocumentDB data
- Access Azure DocumentDB collections from your apps
- Query the Azure Search service connected to a DocumentDB database

Not surprisingly, there is much more you can do to leverage the power of Azure DocumentDB. Experiment with other DocumentDB features, especially [triggers, stored procedures, and user-defined functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/documentdb/documentdb-programming), and identify other ways you can enhance your data and search strategies by integrating Azure DocumentDB into your application ecosystems.
