# Community Content - Azure Web Apps

This folder contains content introducing Azure Web Apps and demonstrating how to build them and deploy them to Azure. The content is divided into two sessions:

- Session 1 - Slides
- Session 2 - Azure Web Apps (HOL)

The HOL may be presented as a hands-on lab or as a demo accompanying the slide deck.
